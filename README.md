# Vants and Turmites

This is the code that created the figures and animation for my Artificial Life paper on the topic.

## How to Run

The code was written for myself, and as such it has a fairly poor user interface (keyboard commands only).

1. Open `turmites/turmites.pde` in the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/).
2. Press the  **Run** button.  This should show you the help screen.
3. Press any key to exit help.  Then press the space bar to see Langton's original Vant.
